    "# Introduction to Twitter Scraping for Researchers\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was written by [John Simpson](mailto:john.simpson@computecanada.ca) and is meant to provide some simple, working examples for researchers who would like to collect information from Twitter.  While Twitter provides their own tools and libraries for this they are a little too granular and possibly unfamiliar to many in the research community.  For this reason this workbook uses a Python library build by a third party that greatly streamlines the process of collecting tweets.  Special thanks is due to Victoria Meah and Miranda Kimber for helping test earlier version of this workbook in support of their research into the impact of social media on pregnancy and fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic familiarity with the Jupyter Notebook environment.\n",
    "2. A functioning python environment on the system it is run in and that you have the authority to install software on it.\n",
    "3. That you have a developer account with Twitter [HERE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/)\n",
    "4. That you have an app created with Twitter [HERE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps)\n",
    "5. That you have a MongoDB instance set up on your machine and appropriately configured.\n",
    "6. That you pay attention to the various notes and warnings around the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "I won't promise you any support but if you send me a note I'll help as I am able.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python library used is called TwitterAPI (no space) and it can be found at https://github.com/geduldig/TwitterAPI.  Most of the code that is throughout this workbook is drawn directly from the examples on these pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all this said, let's get started by installing the TwitterAPI library."

    "Use of this workbook–and the Twitter Developer API (Application Programming Interface) in general—requires a developer account from Twitter.  Unlike the early days of Twitter when anyone with a regular Twitter account who requested a developer account would just be given one, Twitter now screens requests for developer accounts, a process that can stall getting started by many days.  If you had a developer account previously and created applications (apps) that used the Twitter application programming interfaces (APIs) then you may still be able to use these apps to do some work but it is possible that their ability to access the Twitter archive has been reduced and, if so, that you'll need to apply for a new developer account to correct this.  A developer account may be requested from https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply/user (assuming you already have a regular Twitter account).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the [TwitterAPI Documentation](https://geduldig.github.io/TwitterAPI/authentication.html) points out: _Twitter supports both user and application authentication, called oAuth 1 and oAuth 2, respectively. User authentication gives you access to all API endpoints, basically read and write persmission. It is also required in order to using the Streaming API. Application authentication gives you access to just the read portion of the API – so, no creating or destroying tweets. Application authentication, however, has elevated rate limits._ \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use oAuth1 throughout this workbook even though we'll only be reading tweets since it can be used in more situations (in particular when we try to read from the streaming API).  If it is necessary to read Twitter API endpoints (other than the streaming endpoint) at a faster rate than this workbook initially provides then consider switching to oAuth2.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need oAuth1 to do any of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Post Tweets or other resources;\n",
    "* Connect to Streaming endpoints;\n",
    "* Search for users;\n",
    "* Use any geo endpoint;\n",
    "* Access Direct Messages or account credentials;\n",
    "* Retrieve user's email addresses;\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get away with oAuth2 (or application-only authentication) if you are only looking to perform the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pull user timelines;\n",
    "* Access friends and followers of any account;\n",
    "* Access lists resources;\n",
    "* Search in Tweets;\n",
    "* Retrieve any user information, excluding the user's email address;\n",
    "\n",
    "Both authentication methods will require you to collect some information about keys and tokens and paste it into the appropriate section of the cell below.  This key and token information is generated when you create a profile for an app on the Twitter Developer site.  App profiles can be created at https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps.  That same page will hold a list of all the profiles that you have created and clicking on the \"Details\" button for each app will bring you to a summary page.  There will be a link/tab near the top of the page called \"Keys and Tokens\" and clicking this will bring you to the page with the key and token information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paste in the required key and token information from the Twitter Developer site into the cell below and then run it in order to use this workbook.  Remember that you'll need to run the cell below (which loads your credentials) and _one_ of the authorization methods below (default to oAuth1 unless you are sure you need oAuth2)."

    "There are two approaches to collecting information from Twitter: grabbing tweets as they are published and searching through the archive of past tweets.  The first approach is known as \"streaming\" and we'll look at how to use it now (The second we'll call \"standard search\" and we'll look at it next).  It is important to note up front that the results returned using this method are incomplete: you will _not_ necessarily capture every single tweet that you intend to this way.  Still, you can get a lot of tweets in a very short time and likely enough to get you started (assuming your search terms are not overly restrictive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming amounts to applying a set of filters to the stream of all tweets being published from now until we stop reading the stream and capturing what is matched by those filters.  For this first example we'll simply print the body of each tweet out on the screen.  There are lots of opinions about Donald Trump right now so we'll use 'trump' as the term we are tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! IMPORTANT !!!\n",
    "\n",
    "When streaming it is possible for your code to run indefinitely.  In the case of the cell below you'll want to stop it at some point—likely after only a few seconds!—so be prepared to click the stop button at the top of this workbook once you have some tweets in the output cell.  If you leave the search term as 'trump' then you'll have enough tweets to prove that it works after about two seconds!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible that you'll hit a rate limit with the search term \"trump\".  If you approach a 1% sample of all the tweets being published with your request then the API will cut you off.  This will look like a \"key error\" because the code is looking for the key \"text\" in the JSON that is returned but it's not finding it because the API didn't give any text as a response. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, note that the API only returns tweets inside a 10ms window per second.  You will not be getting everything via streaming.\n",

If you really only need a few and only need them once then you can just cut and copy from the output above.  In most cases though you'll want a lot of tweets or want to collect them multiple times.  In such cases the ideal thing to do is write the tweets to a database because then you will have the search features of the database at your disposal.  We'll get to interacting with database later in this workbook but keep in mind that actually setting up that database is beyond the scope of this workbook (If you're not sure where to start, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is worth considering since its internal format is very similar to the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) that tweets come in).\n",

There is some casting values to strings using the `str` function when writing to the output file because the ` .write() `  method requires a single string as an input.
